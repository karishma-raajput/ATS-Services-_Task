Project Title : Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine learning

Projects Description :
This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets (positive or negative) using NaturL language processing (NLP) and Machine learning techniques. It processes raw tweet data, cleans and vectorizes it, it applie a classification model to predict sentiment.


Problem Statement:
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments based on their content. This can help buisness, researchers, and marketers understand public opinion in real-time

Tools Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sci-kit learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- TfidfVectorizer
- Pickle
